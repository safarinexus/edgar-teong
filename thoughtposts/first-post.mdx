# My journey building this website
It has been a pretty cool journey building this site from the ground up. I went from using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) 
and being a purely client-side rendered application to learning about server-side rendering and eventually switching to 
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I have to admit that learning about server-side rendering was a really cool thing and it 
just makes a lot of sense. Concepts of static site generation and hydration and how it is optimised for SEO and enables the 
website even for people with JavaScript disabled, it all just makes so much sense.

I also went through a whole mental and emotional journey in terms of making it. I think overall, I didn't take too long to make the 
site, about two weeks, but I went through a whole journey in my head. Initially, finding a design was difficult and I really 
couldn't imagine how to make it overall, especially when there were so many possibilities that I could do. I guess a better 
way to have tackled this was to plan out the design first then implement, but I just dove headfirst into it and I will 
definitely learn from that \(probably will buy a mini whiteboard to plan coding projects out next time\). 

I then went into the implementation stage, which I struggled with. It had been awhile since I touched React and initially, I faced
quite some self-doubt and had some coding sessions that lasted way too long. One thing I realised was that I definitely can get very lost in coding. 
I was crumbling at the sight of challenges, but the cool thing was that I stuck through them and perservered and what happened after was pretty nice feeling. 
It was an upswing once I gained momentum in solving one thing at a time. I think one of the nicest moments was wondering how I was going to code out all these 
animations that I wanted from scratch, feeling overwhelmed, then Googling and discovering the [GSAP Animation Library](https://gsap.com/) which was so cool. 

Overall, this website has turned out to be one of the coolest things I've built and I'm really 
happy with it. I hope to see it grow in the coming years, whether it's more posts, more content \(I hope to be able to 
add a personal section with my favourite movies, albums, books, etc.\) or just more features \(hoping to add more cool backend ones\).

# But enough about that, more on me. 
Althought it does feel nice that I've finished this part of my website as well, I must say that the only reason why is not a very fun one. 
It's been a rough couple of days because, ever since I finished the main part of this website, I've been applying for jobs and everyone knows 
\(take a peek at the date, hopefully sometime a ways anyone reading back on this will be able to laugh at the tech industry in this state) that 
the tech industry is dog***t right now. Especially for someone in my position, things just aren't looking bright. It's just been really 
anxiety inducing thinking about my future and looking at the state of my apps. It's been so much that I felt pretty overwhelmed about it, so I took 
a break from studying and school stuff to code again. It does feel nice coding again.

Applying has just been messing with my self-esteem lately, and I can't help but feel pretty down about myself. It doesn't help that in school, I have 
to study things that completely doesn't interest me, and that doesn't help with my self-esteem as well. It's just been a pretty rough week.
